# Go Chase It - ROS Project

# Purpose

Go Chase It! This project is included in Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree Program. The goal of this project was to build and program a robot using Gazebo and ROS, to follow a white ball inside a gazebo world environment. Robot's motion could further be observed using Rviz. In this project I started by designing a robot in gazebo, and then placing the robot in another gazebo world I had previously made. I then utilized ROS to control the robots motion by programming differnt nodes in C++ within each catkin package. After completion, the robot was successfully able to follow a white ball around at different locations, while being observed in the gazebo world and in Rviz.
